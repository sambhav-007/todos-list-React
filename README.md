## Features ‚ú®

* **Add Todos:** Easily add new tasks with a title and a description.
* **Delete Todos:** Remove tasks you've completed from the list.
* **Persistent Storage:** Your todo list is automatically saved in your browser's `localStorage`, so your tasks won't disappear when you close the tab or refresh the page.
* **Multi-Page Routing:** Uses React Router for a simple multi-page experience (Home and About pages).
